# Loan-Approval-and-Loan-Amount-Prediction
🏦 Loan Approval & Loan Amount Prediction
This project aims to predict whether a loan application will be approved and estimate the approved loan amount using machine learning models. It uses real-world data and implements various algorithms for classification and regression tasks.

📌 Project Objectives
Predict loan approval status (Yes/No)

Predict expected loan amount

Compare performance of multiple ML models

Build a simple GUI using Tkinter
